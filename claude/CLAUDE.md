# Global Claude Code Preferences

## Code Quality
- Keep functions focused and reasonably sized
- Comment only when the "why" isn't obvious from the code itself
- Test edge cases and error paths, not just happy paths

## Before Writing Code
- Look for project-specific docs (CLAUDE.md, README, docs/) before starting
- Check existing code patterns before introducing new approaches
- Look for existing similar implementations before writing from scratch
- Don't assume - verify with tests or by running the code
- Don't make assumptions about requirements - ask
